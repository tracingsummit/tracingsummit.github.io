The Tracing Summit is a two-day, single-track conference on the topic of
tracing. The event focuses on software and hardware tracing, gathering
developers and end-users of tracing and trace analysis tools. The main goal of
the Tracing Summit is to provide space for discussion between people of the
various areas that benefit from tracing, namely parallel, distributed and/or
real-time systems, as well as kernel development.

## Conference format

* Morning: Presentations
* Lunch
* Afternoon: Presentations and group discussions (Unconference)

The Tracing Summit is part presentations, and part work conference. Like last
year, we plan to have "unconference" style sessions in the afternoons, where
attendees can spontaneously express their interest to discuss various topics in
sub-groups. Participation in this part of the conference will likely only be
available for in-person attendees.

## Presentations

We are welcoming 30 minute presentations from both end users and developers, on
topics covering, but not limited to:

* Investigation workflow of Real-Time, latency, and throughput issues,
* Trace collection and extraction,
* Trace filtering,
* Trace aggregation,
* Trace formats,
* Tracing multi-core systems,
* Trace abstraction,
* Trace modeling,
* Automated trace analysis (e.g. dependency analysis),
* Tracing large clusters and distributed systems,
* Hardware-level tracing (e.g. DSP, GPU, bare-metal),
* Trace visualization,
* Interaction between debugging and tracing,
* Tracing remote control,
* Analysis of large trace datasets,
* Cloud trace collection and analysis,
* Integration between trace tools,
* Live tracing & monitoring,
* Dynamic instrumentation,
* Programmable tracing (e.g. eBPF).

Talks can cover recently available technologies, ongoing work, and yet
non-existing technologies (that are compelling to end-users). Talks covering
interesting or challenging tracing use cases are also welcome as they can reveal
future directions or tooling needs. Please understand that this open forum is
not the proper place to present sales or marketing pitches, nor technologies
which are prevented from being freely used in open source.
