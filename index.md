The 2025 Tracing Summit is a two-day, single-track conference on the topic of
tracing. The event focuses on software and hardware tracing, gathering
developers and end-users of tracing and trace analysis tools. The main goal of
the Tracing Summit is to provide space for discussion between people of the
various areas that benefit from tracing, namely parallel, distributed and/or
real-time systems, as well as kernel development.

## Details

* Location: Montréal, Québec, Canada and virtually
* Dates: Tuesday, September 2 and Wednesday, September 3, 2025
* Cost: free

## Registration
This year tickets are free and seating is limited to 40 people. To register fill out this form: [Tracing Summit Registration](https://pretix.eu/diamon/ts2025/).

## Venue
The event will be held at [Montréal CoWork](https://www.montrealcowork.com/),
[4388 Saint-Denis, Suite 200](https://maps.app.goo.gl/GjRcV3dhgJzx93489).
Located in the heart of the Plateau Mont-Royal borough, it is less than a 5
minute walk from the Mont-Royal metro station on the orange line. Please note
that there is paid parking behind the venue but it is usually full and street
parking is very challenging in the area.

## Presentation Proposals
The Call for Proposals can be found here [Tracing Summit 2025 - Call for Proposals](https://cfp.tracingsummit.org/ts2025/cfp),
it will close on June 13th 2025. The talk selection will then be confirmed by June 20th 2025.


## Presentations
We are welcoming 30 minute presentations from both end users and 
developers, on topics covering, but not limited to:

* Investigation workflow of real-time, latency, and throughput issues,
* Trace collection and extraction,
* Trace filtering,
* Trace aggregation,
* Trace formats,
* Tracing multi-core systems,
* Trace abstraction,
* Trace modeling,
* Automated trace analysis (e.g. dependency analysis),
* Tracing large clusters and distributed systems,
* Hardware-level tracing (e.g. DSP, GPU, bare-metal),
* Trace visualization,
* Interaction between debugging and tracing,
* Tracing remote control,
* Analysis of large trace datasets,
* Cloud trace collection and analysis,
* Integration between trace tools,
* Live tracing & monitoring,
* Dynamic instrumentation,
* Programmable tracing (e.g. eBPF).

Talks can cover recently available technologies, ongoing work, and yet 
non-existing technologies (that are compelling to end-users). Talks 
covering interesting or challenging tracing use cases are also welcome 
as they can reveal future directions or tooling needs.

Please understand that this open forum is not the proper place to 
present sales or marketing pitches, nor technologies which are prevented 
from being freely used in open source.
