## Abstract
The Monado project is a fully open source XR runtime, it provides
drivers, tracking and all other software components to build a XR
platform. It implements the OpenXR API that applications use to deliver
immersive experiences to the users. XR devices includes Quest2, Magic
Leap 2, HoloLens and Valve Index to name a few.

This talk will cover:
* Quick introduction to XR and the problem space of XR frame timing.
* How Perfetto and home grown metrics tools was used in the development
of Monado and how it can be used for XR and other realtime system in
general.
* Thoughts around Perfetto and other tracing tools from a intermediate
tracing user perspective.
