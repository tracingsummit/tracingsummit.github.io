title: Enhancing Performance Tracing and Debugging in Remote Deployments

## Abstract

Enhancing Performance Tracing and Debugging in Remote Deployments: Leveraging
In-Memory Asynchronous Logging and trace log analysis with Google Cloud Platform
(GCP)

Cloud computing and containerization have emerged as dominant paradigms in
modern software development, enabling standardization, portability, efficiency,
and scalability. However, remote deployments pose unique challenges,
particularly in ensuring traceability and facilitating effective debugging when
the away machine or virtual machine (VM) is not directly accessible. The
constraints of setting up asynchronous log emission mechanisms further compound
these difficulties.

This presentation will discuss the challenges of remote deployments and how
in-memory asynchronous logging and trace analysis can be used to address these
challenges. The presentation will cover the following topics:

    1. The foundations and principles of in-memory asynchronous logging;
    2. The benefits of in-memory asynchronous logging; analysis of logs - traceability, queryability, and performance measurement through trace aggregation ;
    3. A case study on the use of this technique and trace modeling, extraction, analysis and automation with Google Cloud Platform (GCP)

The presentation will conclude with a discussion of the outcomes and performance
improvements observed in the case study. Problems such as tracing journeys,
hotspotting and concurrency, file system IO issues and memory leaks and
performance trends which were solved using this technique will be discussed.

Attendees will gain a comprehensive understanding of this technique and its
relevance to remote deployments. They will learn about the practical
implementation of this technique and how it can be leveraged to achieve
traceability and performance measurement in real-world scenarios. Additionally,
insights into the integration with GCP will be shared, enabling attendees to
explore the synergy between these technologies.
